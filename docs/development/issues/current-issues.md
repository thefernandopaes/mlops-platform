# Known Issues and Limitations

This document tracks known issues, bugs, and current limitations in the MLOps Platform.

## 🚧 Current Development Status

### Authentication System
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED  
**Impact:** High  
**Description:** Complete JWT authentication system implemented.

**Completed Work:**
- ✅ Frontend auth context structure complete
- ✅ Backend auth routes fully implemented
- ✅ JWT token generation/validation implemented
- ✅ Password hashing with bcrypt implemented
- ✅ User registration/login logic complete
- ✅ Multi-tenant organization support
- ✅ Role-based access control (RBAC)
- ✅ Comprehensive Pydantic schemas
- ✅ Authentication middleware and dependencies
- ✅ Service layer with business logic
- ✅ Complete test coverage

**Current State:** Backend authentication is production-ready. Frontend integration pending (Task 1.2.2).

**Next Steps:**
1. Connect frontend auth context to real APIs
2. Implement login/register forms
3. Add token storage and management
4. Create protected route components

### Database Integration
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED  
**Impact:** High  
**Description:** Database models and schema implementation completed.

**Completed Work:**
- ✅ Alembic migration setup complete
- ✅ SQLAlchemy configuration prepared
- ✅ 19 database models created (User, Organization, Project, Model, etc.)
- ✅ 4 migration scripts written (incremental approach)
- ✅ Performance indexes and constraints implemented
- ✅ Seed data script created for development
- ✅ Complete documentation provided

**Current State:** Database schema is production-ready with comprehensive model relationships, audit trails, and performance optimizations.

### Frontend-Backend Integration
**Status:** Disconnected  
**Impact:** Medium  
**Description:** Frontend makes no real API calls yet.

**Current State:**
- ✅ API client structure ready
- ✅ TypeScript interfaces defined
- ❌ Real API integration not implemented
- ❌ Error handling incomplete

**Workaround:** Frontend works with mock data and console logs.

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement API client methods
2. Add error handling and loading states
3. Connect forms to real endpoints
4. Add proper validation

## 🐛 Known Bugs

### Development Server Cache Issues
**Severity:** Low  
**Frequency:** Occasional  
**Description:** Next.js development server sometimes requires cache clearing.

**Symptoms:**
- Module resolution errors
- Stale component rendering
- Build artifacts conflicts

**Solution:**
```bash
# Clear Next.js cache
rm -rf .next
npm install
npm run dev
```

## ⚠️ Current Limitations

### Security
- No authentication/authorization implemented
- CORS configured for development only
- No input validation on backend
- No rate limiting

### Performance
- No caching strategy implemented
- No database query optimization
- No image optimization configured
- No CDN setup

### Monitoring

## 📋 Technical Debt

### Code Quality
- TODO comments throughout codebase need implementation
- Error handling is minimal
- No comprehensive input validation
- Missing JSDoc/docstring documentation

### Infrastructure
- Docker images not optimized for production
- No CI/CD pipeline configured
- No environment-specific configurations
- No secrets management

### Dependencies
- Some dependencies may need version updates
- No security audit performed
- No dependency vulnerability scanning

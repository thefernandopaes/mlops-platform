## What are ADRs?

ADRs are documents that capture important architectural decisions made during project development. They help to:

- Record the context and reasoning behind decisions
- Facilitate communication between team members
- Help new developers understand the choices made
- Serve as historical reference

## Naming Conventions

Use the format: `XXX-decision-title.md`

Examples:
- `001-frontend-framework-choice.md`
- `002-database-architecture.md`
- `003-authentication-strategy.md`

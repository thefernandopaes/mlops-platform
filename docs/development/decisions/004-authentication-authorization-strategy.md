# ADR-004: Authentication and Authorization Strategy

## Status
**Accepted** - *2024-12-19*

## Context

The MLOps platform requires a robust authentication and authorization system to support:
- Multi-tenant architecture with organizations
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Secure API access for both web and programmatic clients
- Scalable user management across different organizations
- Token-based authentication for stateless operations

We needed to choose between different authentication strategies and implement a comprehensive security model that supports the platform's multi-tenant nature.

## Decision

We have decided to implement a **JWT-based authentication system with hierarchical RBAC** using the following architecture:

### Authentication Strategy
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for stateless authentication
- **Access tokens** (15-minute expiry) + **Refresh tokens** (7-day expiry)
- **Automatic token refresh** with seamless user experience
- **Secure token storage** using httpOnly cookies for refresh tokens

### Authorization Model
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** with hierarchical permissions
- **Multi-tenant support** with organization-scoped access
- **Three primary roles**: Admin, Member, Viewer
- **Organization-level isolation** for data and resources

### Technical Implementation
- **Backend**: FastAPI with JWT middleware and dependency injection
- **Frontend**: React Context pattern for auth state management
- **Database**: User-Organization-Role relationship tables
- **Security**: bcrypt password hashing, secure token generation

## Rationale

### Why JWT over Sessions?
1. **Stateless**: No server-side session storage required
2. **Scalable**: Works well with microservices and load balancing
3. **Cross-domain**: Supports API access from different origins
4. **Mobile-friendly**: Easy integration with mobile applications
5. **Decentralized**: Tokens can be validated without database queries

### Why RBAC with Organizations?
1. **Multi-tenancy**: Clean separation between different organizations
2. **Scalability**: Easy to add new roles and permissions
3. **Flexibility**: Granular control over resource access
4. **Compliance**: Meets enterprise security requirements

### Why Refresh Token Strategy?
1. **Security**: Short-lived access tokens limit exposure
2. **User Experience**: Automatic refresh prevents frequent logins
3. **Revocation**: Ability to invalidate sessions server-side
4. **Balance**: Security vs. usability trade-off

## Implementation Details

### Backend Components
```
app/core/auth.py          # JWT utilities and middleware
app/core/security.py      # Password hashing and verification
app/api/auth/            # Authentication endpoints
app/models/auth.py       # User, Organization, Role models
app/services/auth.py     # Authentication business logic
```

### Frontend Components
```
contexts/auth-context.tsx    # Global auth state management
components/auth/            # Login, register, protected routes
lib/api-client.ts           # HTTP client with token interceptors
types/auth.ts              # TypeScript interfaces
```

### Database Schema
- `users` table with basic user information
- `organizations` table for multi-tenant support
- `user_organizations` junction table with role assignments
- Proper indexing for performance optimization

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Stateless architecture** enables horizontal scaling
- **Multi-tenant support** allows platform growth
- **Secure by default** with industry-standard practices
- **Developer-friendly** with clear separation of concerns
- **Flexible permissions** system for future requirements
- **Automatic token refresh** provides seamless UX

### Negative
- **Token management complexity** on the frontend
- **JWT size overhead** compared to simple session IDs
- **Token revocation challenges** (mitigated by short expiry)
- **Initial implementation complexity** for RBAC system

### Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: JWT token theft â†’ **Mitigation**: Short expiry + secure storage
- **Risk**: Role escalation â†’ **Mitigation**: Server-side validation
- **Risk**: Organization data leakage â†’ **Mitigation**: Strict tenant isolation

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Session-Based Authentication
- **Pros**: Simpler implementation, easy revocation
- **Cons**: Stateful, scaling challenges, CORS complexity
- **Rejected**: Doesn't align with microservices architecture

### 2. OAuth 2.0 with External Providers
- **Pros**: Delegated authentication, social login
- **Cons**: External dependency, limited customization
- **Future consideration**: May integrate for enterprise SSO

### 3. Simple Role System (No Organizations)
- **Pros**: Simpler implementation
- **Cons**: No multi-tenancy support
- **Rejected**: Doesn't meet platform requirements

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed
- JWT token generation and validation
- User registration and login endpoints
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Frontend auth context and protected routes
- Automatic token refresh mechanism
- Multi-tenant database schema
- Role-based access control foundation

### ðŸ”„ In Progress
